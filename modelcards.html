              Machine learning model distribution suffers from major limitations. First, they often come with limited understanding of how they function. When they are translated into clinical practice, there may exist a potential harm to patients. Thus, there is a missing "label" problem for machine learning models analogous to drug labels. Second, many models on tissue imaging based cancer research are dispersed at various repositories, and there lacks a "directory" of models for users to readily find applicable models for their use. Recently, model cards emerge as a practice on machine learning model characterization and become quickly embraced in machine learning communities. Multiple public model card registries (e.g. Hugging Face and Nvidia, among others) have been created. 
              <br><br>

              Following current practice, we will improve model transparency by model cards for the I3 framework. Model cards will provide detailed information on the model use, such as training dataset, how training and validation were done, known limitations on applicability, estimates of performance in various circumstances, intended use, and potential harms of inappropriate use of the model. We will use the Model Card Toolkit and provide additional annotations on relevant anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers by HubMAP CCF Semantic Ontology. We will provide a repository of model cards for the I3 framework and widely used tissue imaging based models from communities. Model owners can submit an online web form with required model information that can be converted into model cards by the model card toolkit. Meanwhile, we will also create model cards for well-known models from the literature and invite authors to review the cards for publishing on the repository. Users will be able to search models of interest from the repository.
